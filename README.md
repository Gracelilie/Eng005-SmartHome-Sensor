## Project Overview:
This project focuses on implementing a smart home system that transfers temperature data from a sensor to the ThingSpeak web application. The experiment demonstrates the integration of IoT concepts, data processing, and web-based visualization in engineering applications.

### Objectives:
- Implement a system to transfer temperature data to ThingSpeak
- Create level 0 and level 1 block diagrams for the data transfer process
- Use C# for data calculations and processing
- Visualize and analyze the transferred data using ThingSpeak's features

### System Components:
- Temperature Sensor
- Microcontroller
- C# Application
- Wi-Fi Module
- ThingSpeak Web Application

### Data Flow:
1. Temperature Sensor collects raw data
2. Microcontroller reads sensor data
3. C# Application processes and calculates final temperature values
4. Wi-Fi Module sends processed data to ThingSpeak
5. ThingSpeak Server receives and stores the data
6. ThingSpeak Web Interface displays the data for analysis

### ThingSpeak Overview:
ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows users to collect, store, analyze, and visualize data in the cloud. It is commonly used for monitoring and analyzing sensor data and building IoT applications.

### Conclusion:
This lab successfully demonstrated the implementation of a smart home temperature monitoring system using IoT concepts. The integration of C# for data processing and ThingSpeak for visualization showcased the practical application of web technologies in engineering.
